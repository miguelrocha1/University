# About the project
This project is a simulation of the game "Ouri" ("Oware" in English), developed in a terminal environment using the C programming language. Ouri is a two-player game played on a board with twelve (12) houses, two (2) deposits, and forty-eight (48) stones. The goal is to collect more stones in your deposit than your opponent, with the winner being the first to accumulate twenty-five (25) or more stones.
