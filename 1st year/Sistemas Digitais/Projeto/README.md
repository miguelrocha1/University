# About the project
This project details the implementation of a synchronous sequential circuit designed to control a system of two traffic lights, managing both vehicle and pedestrian traffic at a crossing.
The implementation utilizes the digital circuit simulation software Logisim-Evolution.
# Functionalities
- Vehicle Traffic Control: The circuit ensures an orderly flow of vehicular traffic.
- Pedestrian Traffic Control: The circuit provides safe crossing signals for pedestrians.
- Synchronization: Ensures that traffic lights for vehicles and pedestrians do not conflict.
# How to run
To run this implementation, install Logisim-Evolution. After installing, load the .circ file in Logisim-Evolution, then make sure to enable the auto-tick on.
